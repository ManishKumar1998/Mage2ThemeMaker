This is in working Project, For auto creating child theme of presented magento core magento themes. This themeMaker also provide the functionality of Overriding the magento 2 core files by copying that file in the child theme by keeping in mind the structure of magento 2 architecture. But for now it can override Templates soon it will be able to extend LESS file and extens JS also. I will soon add the code for overriding BLOCKS, Controllers and etc. stuff, but for now all this is what present. You can contribute if you knows about the magento Code and it will help us developers to reduce our workload.
